In my initial program, I forgot to free the memory allocated by the mallocs in my program. The valgrind log-file showed I had memory leaks, in which a certain number of bytes were lost. So I wrote a for-loop in my main that iterated through my wordArray, freeing each word pointer according to the wordCount, and then I freed the whole array. 

My valgrind log-file also showed "Invalid write of size 8" in my insertWord function. This was because when I inserted a word from the file and pushed all the word pointers after this new word down 1 in the array, I was making the index of the last word greater than what was allocated in memory for the array. So, in order to avoid this, when checking if the count was greater than the capacity of the array and doubling the size of it, I added 1 to the count to compensate for the word I was inserting.
